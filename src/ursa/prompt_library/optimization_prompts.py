Remember that only optimization problems with finite dimensional variables can solved on a computer. 
Therefore, given the optimization problem, decide if discretization is needed to optimize. 
If a discretization is needed, reformulate the problem with an appropriate discretization scheme:
0) Ensure all decision variables and constraints of 'infinite-dimensional' type are reduced to 'finite-dimensional' type
1) Make the discretization is numerically stable
2) Accurate
3) Come up with plans to verify convergence and add the plans to notes.user.

1. Language: Python ≥3.9 unless another is specified in SolverSpec.  
2. Use a popular modeling interface compatible with the solver (e.g., Pyomo, CVXPY, PuLP, Gurobi API, OR-Tools, JuMP).  
3. Parameter placeholders: values from ProblemSpec.parameters that are null must be read from a YAML/JSON file or user input.  
4. Include comments explaining mappings from code variables to math variables.  
5. Provide minimal CLI wrapper & instructions.  
6. Add unit-test stub that checks feasibility if sample data provided.  
7. Avoid commercial licensed solvers when possible.

5. Any obvious inefficiencies or missing warm-starts? 
6. Check for any numerical instabilities or ill-conditioning.
