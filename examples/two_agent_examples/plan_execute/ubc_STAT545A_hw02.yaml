# logos are a fun little thing where we use a vision model to generate 'logos' for your
# project based on the project name and the randomly generated workspace name
# 'scene' is a wide scene and 'stickers' are a logo-like mascot sticker for your
# project.  
logo:
  enabled: true     # on/off
  scene: random     # e.g., noir, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, etc. ("random" by default)
  stickers: true    # also make sticker variants
  n: 2              # how many variants for each batch
  model: openai:gpt-image-1 # warning: most 'vision' models do not support image *GENERATION*, this one does


# planning_mode must either be 'single' or 'heirarchical'
# single is one pass through planning and then it executes each
#   step of the plan sequentially
# heirarchical starts w/ a single plan, and THEN, for each step it
#   plans that step again (effectively steps 1-10 might turn into
#   1.1 -> 1.5, 2.1 -> 2.3, . . . 10.0 -> 10.7).  This can both
#   increase runtime and result quality substantially
# if you leave it empty, it will just prompt you
planning_mode: # single

  * TITLE: Mini Data Analysis - Gapminder (Python + HTML report)

  Write a standalone Python script (.py) that performs the tasks below and
  generates an HTML page the reader can open locally. Include narrative text in
  the page and demonstrate headings, bullet points, blockquotes, hyperlinks, and
  inline code snippets. Include at least one equation written plainly (e.g.,
  growth_rate = (value_t - value_{t-1}) / value_{t-1}); do not use LaTeX. Follow
  the course naming convention.
    
  * Data - available at: https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt
  * Basic facts: Report the number of observations and variables,
                 list variable names and types, and show basic
                 descriptive statistics or a few targeted summaries). Make at
                 least one figure (e.g., with matplotlib plotting).
  * Produce an HTML page (offline): Create an output/ folder, save any figures as .png into output/,
      Write output/index.html that contains your narrative and embeds the figures 
      No external hosting or internet resources.
