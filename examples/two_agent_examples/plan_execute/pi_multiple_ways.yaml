# this demo isn't intended to give you really high quality results, but
# o3-mini doesn't always work for agentic tasks like URSA, so don't be 
# surprised if you need to pick a slower, higher quality model - these
# things are stochastic after all :).
models:

    - "openai:gpt-5"
    - "openai:o3"
    - "openai:o3-mini"

# planning_mode must either be 'single' or 'heirarchical'
# single is one pass through planning and then it executes each
#   step of the plan sequentially
# heirarchical starts w/ a single plan, and THEN, for each step it
#   plans that step again (effectively steps 1-10 might turn into
#   1.1 -> 1.5, 2.1 -> 2.3, . . . 10.0 -> 10.7).  This can both
#   increase runtime and result quality substantially
# if you leave it empty, it will just prompt you

  * TITLE: Calculate Pi multiple ways

  Your task is to create and test at least 5 different ways of calculating Pi in Python.
  For each method, run your test and save data files (e.g. JSON, CSV, your choice)
  related to convergence tests for that method.  The final output should be a web page
  with a short explanation of each method, an evaluation of both (1) how quickly (time)
  and (2) how many iterations/steps each method took to reach convergence.  Time and
  iterations should be plotted as bar plots.  Also make a 3rd plot, a line plot, showing
  on a single plot each of the methods converging to the known value for Pi.  For this
  3rd plot, the y-axis should be the currently calculated value for Pi and the x-axis is
  the number of steps to reach that result.

  CONSTRAINTS:
    * Select a value, epsilon, for close enough to convergence.  Record it, and note it
      in the web page report.
    * All methods should be run until convergence.  For each, note the number of iterations
      required to reach convergence and also the time.
    * Plots should be attractive, colorful (e.g. each method a different color), and
      created using Seaborn plotting library.
    * No method should be allowed to for more than 5 minutes max.
    * Before running any methods, but after deciding what 5 methods you will use,
      you must hypothesize and save to hypothesis.txt a brief description of your
      hypothesis which method will perform the best.
    * The line plot should include a dashed, black line at the known value for Pi
      via numpy.
    * Be careful with your line plot, it's possible (likely?) that early estimates will be
      very bad and you need to adjust the scale.  You should be sure to make a plot where
      the y-axis scale focuses on the region of interest, not just the worst values.
      For example, if an estimate is 10.0 and then all the rest of the estimates after
      near 3.14 - the plot scale will be zoomed out so far that we cannot see the "action"
      down near 3.14.  You might consider limiting the y-axis to be "around" 3.14 but with enough
      "give" to show the prediction using each method converging.
    * Web page must present the 3 plots, a discussion of each method, the hypothesis,
      and an analysis of results (e.g. whether you validated or refuted your
      hypothesis).
    * Do not display any plots to the user's screen - all plots must be saved to disk!
    * ***You must actually RUN the analysis*** Do not just write it and instruct the user to.
      Write the code, execute it, plot the results based on saved output, generate the web
      page report using the hypothesis.txt and images generated!
