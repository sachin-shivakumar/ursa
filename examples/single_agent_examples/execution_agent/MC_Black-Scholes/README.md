# Using URSA to Write Examples for URSA
This example used the URSA `ursa/examples/two_agent_examples/plan_execute/plan_execute_from_yaml.py`
example to write a single agent example using the ExecutionAgent.  That is, the intention
was to bolster the number of examples by using URSA to help generate those.

First we describe the example written that we include here, a Monte Carlo
Black-Scholes problem.  Then we describe the use of Plan/Execute loop that
generated this example.

## TL;DR
```
python ./run_example.py # this should generate mc_option_convergence.py and run it
python ./validate_outputs.py # checks ./outputs/ dir to confirm files
open ./outputs/plot.png
```

NOTE - this is stochastic, using an LLM in `run_example.py` so it's possible
the filenames will be different.  Adjust accordingly.

## Monte Carlo Black-Scholes Problem
This directory contains an example, prompt (`prompt.md`) which URSA directs
the ExecutionAgent to use to generate a piece of Python code.  That
code will be named `mc_option_convergence.py` (not in the repo, this will
be generated by using that prompt with the ExecutionAgent).

The entry point is `run_example.py`, which the user should try running.
This will use the prompt and should, upon success, generate `mc_option_convergence.py`.
The user can run that themselves by hand, but the example will run it.
This will generate various outputs in the `outputs` directory including
a plot which can be visualized if desired.

## Prompt That Generated the MC Example
This is a bit of Inception, but the above example was generated using the
YAML config input in `ursa_exec_agent_example_run.yaml`.  Interested
parties can view, edit, and even it again (note to use that config
input one needs to run the `plan_execute_from_yaml.py` example
described above, passing this configuration file in.

Note that it expects that in whatever directory you run it, there is
a copy of symlink to a directory named `./ursa/` which it will use to
figure out how to use the ExecutionAgent, other pieces of URSA, and
look at what existing examples we have.
